<h3>Non-coder</h3>
<p>I am <b>not</b> a coder-programmer. I am a writer-artist seeking assistance from those who are. It
  occurred to me that sufficient <i>guidance</i> and <i>instruction</i> might render a bit of the <i>potentially</i> 
quite useful stuff on your site <i>practically</i> useful to the likes of me.</p>
<p>Time and again, googling practical ways to get specific linux-tasks done has <i>drawn</i> me to your site. 
  Time and again a single word -- <i>compile</i> -- has sent me <i>rocketing</i> away. From time to I've tried to
compile some tutorial-exercise-type-thingie. Despite the fact that I have indeed screwed my courage to the sticking place, 
I have --about 90% of the time -- failed. (Oh for the success rate of <i>Shakespeare's</i> <b>Macbeth</b>!)</p>
